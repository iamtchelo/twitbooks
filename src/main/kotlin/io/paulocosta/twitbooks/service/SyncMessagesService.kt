 * unsure on the exact method of obtaining entity. I could start
 * from the timelines and going down on the tweet chain but I would
 * miss the new tweets that way.
 *
 * On the other hand I could try finding the oldest tweet from the
 * friend and going up from there. But that way I might take too long
 * to synchronize the entity.
 *
 * For an MVP one I think the first approach could be better.
